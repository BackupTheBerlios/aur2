0. About
---------------------------

 This document provides a few guidelines for contributing code to the AUR2
 project.

 Compliance with these guidelines will make upstream development easier, and
 will make your code easier to integrate.


1. Coding Style
---------------------------

 1. All code should be indented with spaces. This is effectively the
    following VIM modeline:

        /* vim: set ai ts=4 sw=4 et: */

 2. Recommend removing trailing whitespace. Here is an example for .vimrc

        autocmd BufWritePre *.py normal m`:%s/\s\+$//e ``

 3. Intentation for code is 4 spaces. No hard tabs should appear in source
    files.


2. Patch Submission
---------------------------

 The following patch formats are acceptable, and listed in order of preference.

 1. Use "git format-patch".

    Git patches can be sent with "git send-email", or attached manually.

 2. Use "diff -Nur" to create patches.

    Please try to make diff patches "p1 applicable".


3. Source Code
---------------------------

 The source can be viewed via a web interface at the following url:
 http://git.berlios.de/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=aur2;a=summary

 The git repo can be cloned from one of the following two locations:
 git://git.berlios.de/aur2
 http://aur2.berlios.de/

4. Authors File
---------------------------

 This project has an AUTHORS file. Author names should not appear in the source
 files. Please add your name to the AUTHORS file if you make contributions.


5. Additional Thoughts
---------------------------

 *  Don't get discouraged!

    Any feedback you get, positive or negative, has nothing to do with you. If
    a patch is rejected, try taking the suggestions into account and
    re-submitting.

 *  Be patient.

    Some patches may take a bit longer to get looked over than others. If you
    think your patch got lost in the shuffle, send another email in reply to
    the original asking if anyone has looked at it yet.
